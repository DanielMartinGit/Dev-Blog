# Welcome to my Personal Development Blog!

### Why did I build this blog?
I decided to build this blog page to expand on my ReactJS knowledge and to add something to my Portfolio. This page will reciece periodic updates 
about what I'm working on and what I'm up to. 

### What's my Tech Stack?
Listed below is my current Tech Stack when working on Web Applications:
1. ReactJS
2. VS-Code
3. Figma
4. Git
5. NPM
6. HTML5
7. CSS3
8. Javascript
9. Bootstrap

### What features does this blog support?
The blog posts support a nice amount of features, I have listed them below:
1. Markdown Support for posts (The ability to write posts in Markdown and have Markdown-to-jsx convert). This makes them easily editable and quick to update.
2. Fetching posts from an online database, this allows me to update and add posts without having to upload or commit to the site itself.
3. Code blocks, this allows me to display and show off some code for new topics or implementations I have learned. 

<Code language='javascript'>
const func = () => 
{
    console.log('This is a code snippet');
}

func();
</Code>

Thanks for reading,  
See you in the next post!
