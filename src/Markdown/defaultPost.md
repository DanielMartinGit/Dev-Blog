# Daniel Martin - Personal Blog

### Why did I build this blog?
I built this blog to gain knowledge on ReactJS and as a platform to document my learning as a Front-End Web Developer and anything else I see fit. 

### What tools do I use?
Listed below is my current Tech Stack when working on Web Applications:
1. ReactJS
2. VS-Code 
3. Figma
4. Git 
5. NPM

### What features does this blog support?
The blog posts support a nice amount of features, I have listed them below:
1. Markdown Support for posts (The ability to write posts in Markdown and have Markdown-to-jsx convert). This makes them easily editable and quick to update.
2. Fetching posts from an online database, this allows me to update and add posts without having to upload or commit to the site itself.

<Code language='javascript'>
